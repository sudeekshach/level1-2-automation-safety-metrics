## 📄 Abstract

This report provides a comprehensive theoretical review of safety metrics used in assessing Level 1 and Level 2 automated vehicles, with a focus on **driving assessment** and **human-machine interaction (HMI)**. It synthesizes current literature to identify key performance indicators, methodologies, challenges, and regulatory considerations in this emerging field.

The study aims to guide researchers, developers, and policymakers by illuminating the gaps and opportunities in safety evaluation practices for partially automated vehicles.
